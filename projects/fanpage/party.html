		Don't you know I'm no good for you?
		I've learned to lose you can't afford to
		Tore my shirt to stop you bleeding
		But nothing ever stops you leaving

		Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
		<span class="monstersix">I could lie, say I like that</span>, like it like that
		I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

		Don't you know too much already?
		I'll only hurt you if you let me
		Call me friend, but keep me closer
		(Call me back)
		And I'll call you when the party's over

		<span class="monsterseven">Quiet when I'm coming home</span> and I'm on my own
		And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
		Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

		But nothing is better, sometimes
		Once we've both said our goodbyes
		Let's just let it go
		Let me let you go

		Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
		I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
		I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
