		What is it about them?
		I must be missing something
		They just keep doing nothing
		Too intoxicated to be <span class="monstertwo">scared</span>
		Better off without them
		They're nothing but unstable
		Bring ashtrays to the table
		And that's about the only thing they share

		I'm in their second-hand smoke
		<span class="monsterthree">Still just drinking canned coke</span>
		I don't need a Xanny to feel better
		On designated drives home
		Only one who's not stoned
		Don't give me a Xanny now or ever

		Can you check your Uber rating?
		Oh my god
		(And it's like, wait, like, when?)

		Waking up at sundown
		They're late to every party
		Nobody's ever sorry
		Too inebriated now to dance
		Morning as they come down (come down)
		Their pretty heads are hurting (hurting)
		They're awfully bad at learning (learning)
		Make the same mistakes
		Blame circumstance

		I'm in their second-hand smoke
		Still just drinking canned Coke
		<span class="monsterfour">I don't need a Xanny</span> to feel better
		On designated drives home
		Only one who's not stoned
		Don't give me a Xanny now or ever

		Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
		On your cigarette break
		I can't afford to love someone
		Who isn't dying by mistake
		In Silver Lake

		What is it about them?
		I must be missing something
		They just keep doing nothing
		<span class="monsterfive">Too inoxicated</span>to be scared

		Come down
		Hurting
		Learning
