		Baby, I don't feel so good
		Six words you never understood
		I'll never let you go
		Five words you'll never say
		I laugh along like nothing's wrong
		Four days has never felt so long
		If three's a crowd and two was us
		One slipped away

		<span class="monstersix">I just wanna make you feel okay</span>
		But all you do is look the other way
		I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
		I just kinda wish you were gay

		Is there a reason we're not through?
		Is there a twelve step just for you?
		Our conversation's all in blue
		Eleven "heys" (hey, hey, hey, hey)
		<span class="monsterseven">Ten fingers tearing out my hair</span>
		Nine times you never made it there
		I ate/eight alone at seven, you were six minutes away

		How am I supposed to make you feel okay
		When all you do is walk the other way?
		I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
		I just kinda wish you were gay

		<span class="monstereight">To spare my pride</span>
		To give your lack of interest an explanation
		Don't say, I'm not your type
		Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
		I'm so selfish
		But you make me feel helpless, yeah
		And I can't stand another day
		Stand another day

		I just wanna make you feel okay
		But all you do is look the other way
		I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
		I just kinda wish you were gay
		I just kinda wish you were gay
		I just kinda wish you were gay
