  <div class="item3"><div class="date">3.17.2020</div>Hey guys. I’m so sorry for the way I have offended anyone and everyone who has seen the clip from my instagram live yesterday. I realize my words were insensitive and not at all appropriate for the situation our country and the world are in right now. This has been a huge wakeup call about the significance my words have, now more than ever. I’m sending safe wishes to everyone to stay safe and healthy during this crazy time.
